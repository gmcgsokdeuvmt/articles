# Color Domination
初めまして、ランと申します。今回は48時間ゲームジャム**「Color Domination」**というゲームを作りました。今回のテーマが**「進化と反射」**ということで、

行く道を**反射**によって阻まれながら、色を変えることで適応し**進化**して乗り越えていく

ということをイメージして作ってみました。色を題材にしたので、できるだけビビッドな色が出るように工夫する点が難しく、勉強になりました。

**是非、楽しんでもらえたらと思います。よろしくお願いします。**

# 操作方法

|キーボード入力|操作|
|:----|----:|
|カーソルキー|移動|
|Z|隣り合った円の色をコピーする|
|X|自機が白色になる|
|C|自機が白色の時、ゲージが貯まった状態で押すと、円を白色にする。|
